# COMP 562 Final Project

_Intro to Machine Learning (Fall 2022)_ 

This repository contains our final report, a copy of the dataset ([WHO National Life Expectancy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmattson/who-national-life-expectancy)), and the source code (.ipynb).

## Abstract

We predict life expectancy from widely available national metrics such as income, schooling and child mortality.
We evaluate the suitability of 5 different machine learning models. Using Random Forest, a root mean square error of only 1.92 years is achieved.
